# leads-tracker
A chrome extension built using web technologies 

This project is inspired by a youtube tutorial by freeCodeCamp
This chrome extension is meant to be a product used by sales representatives, who can save "leads" for certain personlities which showed some potential interest in their product and can be reached out to. 

The extension is created using html, css and javascript, with a json object to model the extension. The tutorial also introduced me to APIs and the extension uses the google tabs API to save the URL of the current tab. 
It also uses the web's local storage to safe-keep that data, which can later be accessed or deleted. 

A short demo for this extension can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D_A9U3iShh0H2bCP_dz6BwBdrG3VCeqi/view?usp=sharing
